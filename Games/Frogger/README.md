# Frogger

Our project was an implementation of the classic game frogger. The game features multiplayer with a set number of lives.

The keys to control the characters are a-w-s-d and the arrow keys. The frogs are sent back to their starting locations once they die. Along with this once you reach the end of the platform you get an added score and are sent to the start of the board.


To create the game, we used Pygame which is libray of Python. I personally did not construct any of the graphics. The background and moving images are all sprites that I find online. The animated objects are animated by flipping between sprites periodically. Pygame handles the rects and collisions.
